                            Local storage is a web
                            storage API that
                            allows you to store
                            key-value pairs in the
                            browser. Local storage
                            is persistent, meaning
                            that data stored in
                            local storage will not
                            be deleted even if the
                            browser is closed or
                            the computer is
                            restarted. Local
                            storage has a larger
                            storage capacity than
                            cookies and session
                            storage, and can store
                            up to 5-10 MB of data
                            per domain. Local
                            storage is scoped to
                            the domain and is
                            accessible across
                            different tabs and
                            windows.

                            Session storage is
                            similar to local
                            storage in that it
                            allows you to store
                            key-value pairs in the
                            browser. However,
                            session storage is not
                            persistent, meaning
                            that data stored in
                            session storage will
                            be deleted when the
                            browser is closed.
                            Session storage has a
                            smaller storage
                            capacity than local
                            storage, and can store
                            up to 5-10 MB of data
                            per domain. Session
                            storage is scoped to
                            the current tab or
                            window, and data
                            stored in session
                            storage is not
                            accessible from other
                            tabs or windows.
